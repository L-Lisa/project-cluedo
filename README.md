# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer
This is my second week into learning js, this project was supposed to teach me more about loors and arrays. 
I tried to fucus on learning more than the design, will make tome to come back for that. Boot-camp life is stressful! 


## The problem
I get stuck in the details. I need to be stricter with my time allocation and ask for help when i need it. When I do, I need to practice formulating my questions in the best way.
